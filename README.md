# JUnit
A simple JUnit example


For running this application you need to install intelliJ IDEA. the second step would be opening the project in intelliJ enviroment and after that you should run the "ServerMain" and then you can run "ServerMainTest" to run all the tests.


**** It's important to have the right version of jdk, I'm using jdk 1.8.0_192. After installing the proper jdk version, for setting up that version in intelliJ you should use File -> Project structure. ****
